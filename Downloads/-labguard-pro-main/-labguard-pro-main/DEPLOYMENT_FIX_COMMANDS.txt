DEPLOYMENT FIX COMMANDS
======================

The issue is that Vercel is configured to deploy from the 'master' branch, but our fixes are on the 'main' branch.

Run these commands in your terminal (one by one):

1. Switch to master branch:
   git checkout master

2. Merge our fixes from main branch:
   git merge main

3. Push to master branch:
   git push origin master

4. Check that it worked:
   git log --oneline -3

After running these commands, Vercel should automatically trigger a new deployment from the master branch with our fixes.

The fixes we made:
- Fixed Prisma import: @/lib/prisma -> @/lib/db
- Fixed nodemailer dependency conflict: added overrides to force version 6.6.5

If you get any merge conflicts, just accept the changes from main branch.
