## =============================================================================
## 12. DEPENDENCY MAPPING
## =============================================================================

### PHASE DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4
- Phase 6 depends on Phase 5

### FEATURE DEPENDENCIES
- Equipment management depends on user management
- Calibration depends on equipment management
- Compliance depends on calibration
- AI features depend on data management
- Analytics depend on all data collection

### DATABASE DEPENDENCIES
- User table is independent
- Laboratory table depends on nothing
- Equipment depends on Laboratory and User
- Calibration depends on Equipment and User
- All other tables depend on these core tables

### API DEPENDENCIES
- Authentication endpoints are independent
- Equipment endpoints depend on authentication
- Calibration endpoints depend on equipment
- Compliance endpoints depend on calibration
- AI endpoints depend on all data

## =============================================================================
## END OF BACKUP DOCUMENTATION
## =============================================================================

This backup file contains everything needed to restore the complete LabGuard Pro enterprise laboratory management system. Follow the restoration roadmap carefully to avoid dependency issues and ensure all features are properly restored.

Remember to test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next phase. The success of the restoration depends on careful attention to dependencies and proper testing at each checkpoint.
