## **üöÄ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Week 1-2: MVP Development**
```python
# Choose ONE template to start (recommend #4: Balance Calibration)
class BalanceCalibrationValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.template = BALANCE_CALIBRATION_TEMPLATE
        
    def validate_calibration(self, equipment_data):
        prompt = self.template.format(**equipment_data)
        result = openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return self.parse_compliance_result(result)
```

### **Week 3-4: Web Interface**
- Simple React dashboard
- Equipment data input forms  
- Compliance report generation
- PDF export functionality

### **Week 5-6: Customer Validation**
- Deploy at girlfriend's lab
- Get 2-3 pilot customers
- Collect feedback and iterate
- Generate first revenue

## **üìä COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS**

### **Current Market Gap:**
Most lab software is **ancient and clunky**:
- ‚ùå **Epic Beaker:** Expensive, complex, not AI-powered
- ‚ùå **Cerner PowerChart:** Hospital-focused, poor usability  
- ‚ùå **LabWare LIMS:** Legacy system, no modern AI
- ‚ùå **Thermo SampleManager:** Equipment-focused, limited scope

### **Your Advantage:**
- ‚úÖ **AI-native compliance checking**
- ‚úÖ **Modern, intuitive interfaces**
- ‚úÖ **Domain expert validation** (your girlfriend)
- ‚úÖ **Modular, affordable pricing**
- ‚úÖ **Rapid deployment** (days vs. months)
