# ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT THIS PROMPT IS ASKING FOR**

This prompt is asking me to create **AI prompt templates** - basically the "instruction sets" that would power your lab compliance automation products. Think of it as creating the **"brains"** for the products I just listed.

Specifically, it wants:
- **Reusable prompt templates** that can be plugged into Claude/GPT
- **Safety-first compliance checking** for lab procedures  
- **Modular design** so variables can be swapped (different tests, labs, etc.)
